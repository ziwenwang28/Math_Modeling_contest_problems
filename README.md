# Math_Modeling_contest_problems


In the context of competitions like the Mathematical Contest in Modeling, where a substantial number of papers (P) must be evaluated by a group of judges (J), the development of an effective selection scheme is paramount. For instance, imagine a scenario with 100 papers (P = 100) and eight available judges.

### Initial Challenge

In an ideal world, each judge would thoroughly review and rank every paper. However, practical constraints, such as the large number of papers, make this approach unfeasible. Instead, a multi-step process is employed. Judges conduct initial screening rounds where they assess and score a subset of the papers. Subsequently, a selection mechanism is applied to reduce the number of papers under consideration. This reduction could involve discarding the lowest-ranked 30% of papers from each judge's perspective or applying a cutoff score based on numerical ratings (e.g., 1 to 100).

### Reevaluation and Iteration

The remaining papers are then reevaluated by the judges, and this process iterates. It's crucial to ensure that each judge reads significantly fewer papers than the total number of papers (P). The process continues until a set number of papers, denoted as W (e.g., W = 3 for P = 100), remains, and these are declared as the winners.

### The Problem

The challenge at hand is to design a selection scheme that could incorporate elements of rank-ordering, numerical scoring, or other techniques. The goal is to ensure that the final W papers consistently come from the top 2W papers, assuming there is a consensus on an absolute rank-ordering of paper quality. Importantly, the scheme should minimize the number of papers each judge must read.

### Addressing Systematic Bias

It's essential to consider the possibility of systematic bias in numerical scoring schemes. For instance, one judge may consistently give an average score of 70 while another may average 80. The selection scheme should account for and mitigate such potential bias.

### Flexibility and Adaptability

Furthermore, the scheme should be designed to adapt to changes in contest parameters, including the total number of papers (P), the number of judges (J), and the number of winning papers (W). It should be flexible enough to accommodate different contest scenarios while maintaining fairness and efficiency in selecting the winners.
