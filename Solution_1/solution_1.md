Initialization and Setup: The code begins by initializing various variables, including the number of papers (P = 100), the number of winners to select (W = 3), the number of judges (J = 8), and other parameters. It also generates random scores and ranks for the papers.

Paper Elimination Loop (First While Loop): In the first while loop, the code aims to reduce the number of papers under consideration. It does this by partitioning the papers among the judges and eliminating a certain percentage of the lowest-ranked or lowest-scored papers. The process continues until the number of papers is reduced to J*W or lower.

Further Paper Elimination (Second While Loop): In the second while loop, the code continues to narrow down the selection. It simulates a process where papers are further assessed and eliminated based on their scores and rankings. This loop reduces the number of papers to 2*W or lower.

Mapping Results: The code maps the results (randomly generated) to specific ranges and sorts the papers based on the calculated scores. It then displays the indexes of the best papers selected.

Check for Errors: The code checks for errors in the top papers selected based on real scores and ranks. It identifies potential discrepancies between the papers selected by the simulation and the actual best papers. If there are errors, it increments an error counter.

Simulation Statistics: The code keeps track of simulation statistics, including the number of correct selections and the value of P (the number of papers).

Repeat Simulation: The main loop repeats the simulation 100 times to obtain statistical information and calculate the mean, maximum, and minimum results.
